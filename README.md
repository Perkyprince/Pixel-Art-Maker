# Pixel-Art-Maker
Pixel Art Maker is a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas! It is the final project for the front end track given as a 7 Days of Code Challenge which is an individual project/program completion task for the ALC learners.

In this project **Pixel Art Maker**, I added some new functionalities and these functionalities are the _**Clear Color**_ button and _**Reset**_ button. The _**Clear Color**_ button will clear the whole color from the grid when clicked while the _**Reset**_ button will remove the whole grid when clicked; this is done incase the user want to start afresh.

## Appreciation
I say a very big **Thank You** to [ALC](https://andela.com), [Google](www.google.com) and [Udacity](www.udacity.com). I cannot thank you enough for this opportunity given to me to become a front end developer! You are nothing less than a blessing from God! Through this opportunity given to me, I have been able to garner a whole lot of experience; I learnt HTML and CSS and how to design and build stunning and engaging websites. I was able to connect with friends and mentors, ask questions and get feedbacks. Thank you so much for this; I will forever remain indebted as I look forward to qualifying for the follow-up scholarship for a Nanodegree program.
